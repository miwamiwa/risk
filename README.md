# Doodle Risk 
Three player LAN Risk for Processing.
A hobby project for the confinement period, to be played with two room mates. 

Work is still in progress, but the current version is playable with a bit of setup:
As of right now, in order to play, the host opens and launches the server first (risk/server/server.pde). All players (including host) can then open their own  client file (risk/clientA1/clientA1.pde), enter the host's IP at line 104 and their own username at line 1, then launch the client. Game starts once three people have joined.
